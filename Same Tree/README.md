## 100.  Same Tree

Easy

Given the roots of two binary trees  `p`  and  `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex2.jpg)

**Input:** p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex3.jpg)

**Input:** p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in both trees is in the range  `[0, 100]`.
-   `-104  <= Node.val <= 104`
